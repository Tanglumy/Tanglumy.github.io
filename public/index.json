They are widely used in various intelligent applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the evolution of various types of knowledge graphs (i.e., static KGs, dynamic KGs, temporal KGs, and event KGs) and techniques for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce the practical applications of different types of KGs, including a case study in financial analysis. Finally, we propose our perspective on the future directions of knowledge engineering, including the potential of combining the power of knowledge graphs and large language models (LLMs), and the evolution of knowledge extraction, reasoning, and representation.","tags":[],"title":"On the Evolution of Knowledge Graphs: A Survey and Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiashuo Sun","Chengjin Xu","Lumingyuan Tang","Saizhuo Wang","Chen Lin","Yeyun Gong","Lionel M.

Recent works on COVID related question answering (QA) systems have leveraged retrievalbased structures and yielded promising results, yet sometimes their answers could become unreadable for most users due to the highly technical nature of their knowledge source. We propose RC-RAG for Readability Controlled Retrieval Augmented Generation, an open-domain question-answering system on COVID related topics, which is capable of generating answers of a chosen readability score given a COVID-related question. Our model is proved to generate answers of different readability levels, and could meet the requirements of people with different levels of education. We hope our system will be able to aid researchers and the general public to go through this tough time together.","tags":[],"title":"Readability Controlled Open-domain QA for COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"a light ﬁle transfer tool using agile development methodologies on Tencent Agile Product Development platform.\n","date":1622073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622073600,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"Gasolsun.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2021-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"Gasolsun.github.io/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"the Third Prize in the North China Division, WeChat Mini Program Application Development Contest 2021 (Top 15%)","tags":["Software Engineering"],"title":"FeatherTrans","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"Gasolsun.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"Gasolsun.github.io/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
